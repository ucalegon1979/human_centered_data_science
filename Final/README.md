## data-512-Final: DATA 512 Final: Mass Shoootings

## __Project Goals__

The goal of this project is to establish if we can say anything meaningful about mass shootings while studying them in isolation apart from other kinds of shootings.

## __Software Requirements__

Python 3.0 at a minimum is required to run the project. Additionally you will need to be able to import the following libraries in order to load, transform, call the API. The following are import statements required to run the code.

    import pandas
    import matplotlib
    import numpy
    import scipy    
    import sklearn
    import statsmodels
    
In order to run the code from the ipynb notebook file, you will also need Jupyter Notebook.

## __Data__

Mother Jones (MJ) presents the context and their own analysis of their data at the location below.
