    "# Mass Shootings In The United States:\n",
    "### *A study to overcome long-held biases about gun violence.*\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass shootings in the United States since 1999 have become alarmingly frequent, and they are happenning at an increasing rate [1]. Others would dismiss this problem for reasons as simple as where they get their news, or if they happen to own guns.  In every case when there is a mass shooting, there are impassioned calls to ban guns in the United States, with gun-control advocates enthusiastically sharing comparisons of the U.S. to other countries where mass shootings do not happen. Frustratingly, there are many people who do not consider mass shootings a problem. They oftentimes belittle the lack of knowledge about guns by gun-control advocates, making fun of them, minimizing or ignoring the purpose of guns, deflecting, saying an \"evil\" person will always find a way to kill [2]. These gun enthusiasts ignore or avoid simple questions such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) How easy is it to kill many people with weapons other than guns? \n",
    "\n",
    "2) How likely a person would commit murder if they did not have a gun?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) How easy it is to obtain a gun in the United States, compared to other things which are far less deadly, like a passport.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a deep divide in the United States about if the existence of so many guns has anything to do with the frequency of mass shootings. Some say when we focus on mass shootings, we forget about all the ordinary murders that happen with guns, the accidents, and suicides, and that we are missing the point. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "My purpose is to uncover any truths surrounding the gun \"issue\" in the United States as it relates to mass shootings only. Is it really, as many right-wing politicians say, only a mental-health issue? Some say it isn't a white male problem, and they deflect, pointing to the Washington DC snipers who were both African American, the Virginia Tech shooter who was South Korean. \n",
    "\n",
    "The deflection continues, with some lawmakers saying trucks are used to kill, so, as the logic goes, should we ban trucks? Others say that people will still find guns illegally, and that any attempt to control guns will only hurt law-abiding gun owners. It has been shown that mass killings in the United States are most often carried out with guns, usually handguns, most of them obtained legally [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "The intransigence against even attempting to research *if* there is a problem with gun violence reached a nadir in 1997. Congress cut funding for the CDC by the exact amount that had been spent on gun research in the year before, citing the CDC should be prevented from doing any research that \"advocate or promote gun control\". [4] This put a chilling affect on gun violence research for over a decade. The fact that there is not a single place where you can go to find complete data on gun violence has something to do with how taboo it is seen by many public officials in the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "My hope is that I will show how ridiculous the intransigence is. Before embarking on this research, I already believe the sheer number of untrained, unlicensed, well-armed, angry people in this country are making the United States a terrorized country from within, nevermind the external threat of terrorism, and its impact across the culture is a chilling affect affecting everyone's quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Who qualifies as a mass shooter is a hotly debated topic. [5] What qualifies as a mass shooting also is a blurry issue. The FBI, Congressional Research Office, municipal police departments, all collect data differently, all have slightly different definitions. By some measures, in 2015 we had 355 mass shootings according to the Washington Post, and another, Mother Jones, only four in 2015 [6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first most commonly held definition is by the Federal Bureau of Investigation [7]: \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"public mass shooting\" as one in which four or more people selected indiscriminately, not including the perpetrator, are killed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This definition would exclude a 1 AM gang shootout at IHOP in Chicago in which four people are killed, and a grandmother killing her entire family of four in White Center in 2010 [8]. It *would* include a man entering a movie theater and killing dozens of random people in Aurora, Colo.\n",
    "    \n",
    "All these definitions wrestle with the following __problems__ when defining a mass shooting [9]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Over what period of time is the distribution of individual killings? All in the span of several hours with no \"cooling off period\"? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the geographic distribution of a mass shooting? A music venue, an entire city? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are we confusing mass shooters with mass shootings? These are not neccessarily events which are perpetrated by only one person per incident. Should we focus on shooters or shootings?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How many people have to be killed, for the incident to be called a mass shooting? \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Are the victims related to the shooters in any way? Are they relatives, friends, close co-workers, or complete strangers?\n",
    "\n",
    "For my purposes, I will be using the FBI's fairly loosely-defined definition, with the understanding that it has changed over time, and will be applying this definition retroactively upon the data that has been collected, but only to eliminate instances that do not meet this definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "##### H0: The number of mass shooters who are white males is inversely correlated to the share of the population over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to determine if perhaps there is social pressure on white males, with other races taking a larger share of the population over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### H1: White males are more likely to murder more people during mass shootings than other races. \n",
    "\n",
    "Has the description of a mass shooting which has changed over time, unfairly painted white males as a public menace?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### H2: Mass shooters more likely to suffer from mental illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some would say, anyone willing to kill is suffering from mental illness, but I'm looking for evidence in their behavior, whether or not they were seen by a mental health professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### H3. White, male, mass shooters are more likely to suffer from mental illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### H4: Mass murderers from all races are equally likely to use gun violence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the weapon of choice by white male mass shooters different than shooters of other races?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be drawing from several datasets, to cover the various hypotheses. I will be doing so because there is no central repository of mass shootings in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Mother Jones http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/\n",
    "\n",
    "Mother Jones manages a database they say is a ultimate source of the 92 mass shootings that have occurred in the U.S. since 1982.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### US Mass Shootings Dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset on Kaggle contains 320 \"mass shootings\" since 1966.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Data.gov Crimes in Chicago Dataset https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crimes-2001-to-present-398a4\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset managed by the City of Chicago, I hope will help me identify FBI-defined mass shooting incidents that are not in the other two sources, mainly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using Python to clean, analyze and transform the data from Mother Jones, Kaggle, and Chicago crime data from Data.gov. Because there is no one source for mass shooting data, there are some concerns about the selection bias of each source of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be combining sources of mass shottings into one dataset. This will be to union mass shooting incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the selection bias in the data, I will be looking at the following aspects and how they differ between datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The geographic distributions of the data between datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The types of weapons used (handgun/shotgun/rifle(bolt/pump/semi-automatic)), how they are represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The relative proportions of races, genders of those shooters represented between shooter datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The time periods covered, and if there are any large gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How the different definitions of mass shootings has changed over time within each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
