## data-512-a2: DATA 512 Assignment 2: Bias

## __Project Goals__

The goal of this project is to highlight biases found in data about Wikipedia articles. Specifically we will compare the proportion of "good" articles to each countries population.

To do this we will download page data, using a special REST API, called ORES, from Wikimedia to get the page quality for each article by sending its revision ID. After that is done, we can aggregate the data by country, pair with population data from each country and then perform our analysis.

## __Software Requirements__

Python 3.0 at a minimum is required to run the project. Additionally you will need to be able to import the following libraries in order to load, transform, call the API. The following are import statements required to run the code.

    import requests
    import pandas
    import json
    
In order to run the code from the ipynb notebook file, you will also need Jupyter Notebook.

## __Data__

The population data was gleaned from the Population Research Bureau website at the link below.
